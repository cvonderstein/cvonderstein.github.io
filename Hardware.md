# Hardware

This section will talk about different hardware things:
Hardware I use, embedded stuff I use/build and more.

As I'm a student, I currently do nearly all my work from home using my own hardware.
You definetly don't need this kind of hardware to study computer science, I would even go as far as saying you don't need this kind of hardware to study anything.
I talk about what kind of hardware you need for studying on [this page](Hardware/Studying-Computer-Science.md).
Anyway, it's nice to have a fast PC and as I work the whole day on this machine (and also use it for gaming), I want it to be fast (and quiet).
