### Jewel Contrast (rainglow)

I mainly use the Jewel Contrast (rainglow) Theme, which is part of the [Rainglow](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=daylerees.rainglow) Extension by Dayle Rees.
I like the colors, they are not annoying and are easy to read.

### Bearded Theme arc

I saw a Twitch Streamer using the [Bearded Theme Arc](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=BeardedBear.beardedtheme) by BeardedBear, I'm currently trying this.
Not that I want to get rid of the Jewel Contrast Theme, but some variety is always good.
