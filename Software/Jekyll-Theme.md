# Jekyll-Theme

## Requirements

So, my requirements are:

- Look kind of modern (doesn't need to be too fancy, but a 2005 look is not what I'm looking for)
- Have a sidebar for easier navigation
- Text should not be too wide, it should better have a smaller design in the center of the page to make reading easier

## Themes I took a look at

I also looked at many more Themes, but they were so much out of scope <ins>for my purpose</ins>(!) that I didn't even care writing my opinion about it.

### [Minimal Mistakes](https://jekyllthemes.io/theme/minimal-mistakes)

Looks nice but not the kind of Sidebar I'm looking for (I think, maybe I overlooked something).

### [Agus Makmun](https://jekyllthemes.io/theme/agusmakmun-github-io)

Looks interesting, not as modern (I worry about the scaling on mobile devices).
Might be the one.

### [Vonge](https://jekyllthemes.io/theme/vonge)

I literally opened this like three times when going through the library because it looks good, only thing it misses is a sidebar though.
I'm not sure how I could replace this.

### [Contrast](https://jekyllthemes.io/theme/contrast)

Nice one, doesn't show a sidebar here, but on the bottom is a picture where it has a sidebar.

### [Simple](https://jekyllthemes.io/theme/jekyll-simple)

As the title says, its simple.
Also contains a sidebar, so this might be something if there are no other Themes that fit.

### [Just The Docs](https://jekyllthemes.io/theme/just-the-docs)

This might be it.
The focus is more on documentation, but I think this fits the purpose of this page better than Blog or Portfolio themes.

## My decision

In the end, the purpose this site has is mostly documenting stuff for myself, but I'm happy to help other people with this, which is why I'm publishing it.
This probably the reason why the [Just the docs](#just-the-docshttpsjekyllthemesiothemejust-the-docs) Theme fits my purpose the best.
