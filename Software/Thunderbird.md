# Thunderbird

## Joining Twitch Chats using Thunderbird

Thunderbird can't join a Twitch Chat without manually setting some configs.
First, you need a oauth token, then you need to set your options as explained by `Martin Giger [:freaktechnik]`.
You can open this config dialog by clicking the three bars in the upper right, going to Settings -> General -> Edit Configuration (in the bottom).

TODO: Write a 'proper guide' for this without relying on links when I'm done writing my Bachelor's Thesis. :)

Btw. recorded chat logs are stored in

- Windows: `%appdata%\Thunderbird\Profiles\<profile>\logs`
- Linux: `~/.thunderbird/<profile>/logs/`
