### Compile on Linux

So, this is actually the most important thing in my opinion.
Compiling LaTeX on Linux gained me 3-7 times faster compile times (depending on the content of the document) compared to Windows and macOS, even though I'm running this inside a virtual machine on the same hardware.
Yes, you heard it right.
On my normal desktop that I use for my daily work, I'm running a Ubuntu virtual machine, which I connect to using the [Remote - SSH](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh) plugin of VS Code (more on this [here](VSCode.md#remote-ssh)).
