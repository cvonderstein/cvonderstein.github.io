## Some explanations

### OS

My "Server" currently runs Windows 10, as this is basically my old PC.
I migrated to my [new PC](Main-PC.md) already a few months ago, but I didn't spend much time yet to look if I forgot to move over some important files.
As this machine is not yet running 24/7, but only when I need it (and mostly for some VMs), I'm okay with running my old Windows Installation on it and my priority to finally clean this machine up and switch to a different OS is pretty low.
