# Old PC

This is my old PC, which I'm planning on giving to my dad, as he really needs a new pc.
My original plan was to use this machine as a home server, but after I played a little bit with power saving options, I decided to trash this plan, as I probably never get this machine down to a reasonable 24/7 power draw while keeping it at usable speed.

Just according to the calculation on [Home-Server/Power-Tuning](home-server/power-tuning), resulting in 3,50â‚¬ per year per watt constant power draw, if a new machine idles about 15W lower, this saves about the cost of new hardware over the next 10 years (expected time the server will run), while also bringing

- the benefit of having ECC,
- providing more speed and,
- having a "new" machine for my dad.

I'm keeping the hardware on here, as this is currently still in my usage, and I also want to have this list of hardware in case I need to look something up.

## The Hardware

- CPU: Intel Core i7-5820k (6 cores @ 4.2 GHz) - soon to be down to stock 3.3 GHz again for energy saving
- CPU Cooler: Noctua NH-D15
- RAM: 48GB: 4x 4 GB Crucial Ballistix Sport DDR4 2400 MHz + 4x 8 GB Crucial Ballistix Sport LT DDR4 2400 MHz
- Mainboard: Asrock X99 Extreme 4
- GPU: None, not needed currently (soon to be my old GTX 770 2GB, which my dad currently has in his pc)
- SSD 1: Samsung 970 EVO Plus 500GB (OS and Programs)
- SSD 2: SanDisk (former System Drive, now used for e.g. TrueNAS Cache)
- HDD 1: Seagate 2TB
- HDD 2: old WD 500GB drive that was lying around
- HDD 3: WD Red 4TB
- HDD 4: External USB HDD, 4TB WD My Passport
- PSU: 700W beQuiet System Power 7
- Case: none, lies open on a table :)
- OS: Windows 10 ([see explanation](#os))

## Some explanations

### OS

> This is outdated and still from the time when I planned to use this machine as a server.

My "Server" currently runs Windows 10, as this is basically my old PC.
I migrated to my [new PC](Main-PC.md) already a few months ago, but I didn't spend much time yet to look if I forgot to move over some important files.
As this machine is not yet running 24/7, but only when I need it (and mostly for some VMs), I'm okay with running my old Windows Installation on it and my priority to finally clean this machine up and switch to a different OS is pretty low.
