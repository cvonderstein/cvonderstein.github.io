# Studying Computer Science

You sure need a good and expensive laptop/notebook to study, right?

Well, no.
Let me explain why.

Before we get into this, please note that I can only report from my point of view as computer science student at RWTH Aachen University, although I know that this actually holds for many courses of study.

## What do you do

The most of the time you will listen to lectures (either in presence or online, which I come to later), do exercises or write summaries or similar things.
In the end, this is a lot of theoretical work and nothing processor intensive.

## If you need a lot of power, there is Claix

## Maybe even rent a server

## In the end, its of course nice to have a fast machine

## Things you should focus on

- Display (good one, especially it should be bright enough)
- Good feeling keyboard
- Good touchpad, you don't want to use an external mouse all day when changing between lecture halls (and you might not even have enough space)
- Good battery run time

## Things you can pretty much ignore

- OS
  - Linux is free (although it seems to cause problems with Zoom)
  - if you want Windows, its also free for students
  - pretty much all software in science runs on Linux, most also on Windows
- Processor power
  - you mainly work on PDFs
  - might program small (very small) applications
  - if you need a lot of power, there is always Claix to the rescue

## Cheapest possible setup in my opinion (didn't try it)

- Raspberry Pi (then you should get)
