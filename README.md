## About this page

This page is just under construction, so you can expect some TODOs in here :)

### Structure

The structure of this page looks as follows.
Also, there are some things I want to point out, as they are not only about myself but might also contain information, which is relevant for others.

- Hardware: Many Hardware things, concerning real computers (like actual ones, not IoT Stuff)
- Software:
- Other
  - 3D Printing: What I use for 3D Printing, how I do it and some tips. Although this is mostly information for myself to remember it.
