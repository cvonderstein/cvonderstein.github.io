# 3D Printing

## Testing and calibrating your printer

I used several tests to calibrate my printer.

- [3DBenchy](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:763622)
- [XYZ 20mm Calibration Cube](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1278865)
- [MINI All In One 3D printer test](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2806295)

.. and some more, but these are the most important ones.
As I got already very good slicing profiles from a friend who has the same printer, there was not that much testing neccessary.

## Software I use

### Modeling

For modeling, I use Solidworks.
At RWTH, the Software Shop offers student licenses for 5â‚¬, which are nice for learning Solidworks (you don't have to be enrolled in any course related to it).

### Slicing

I do the slicing with Cura.
I have no idea if other programs are better, this is just what my friend recommended me, so I use it.
It works pretty good for me, so there is currently no need to change it (which would probably require a lot of work to get the profiles again and other things).
